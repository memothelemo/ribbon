## Riboon

An alternative program to [lemur](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/lemur)
(not planning to be successor of it) that implements most of Roblox's API in
order to enable Roblox projects to have continuous integration without
depending on Roblox Studio in some CIs (like [run-in-roblox](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/run-in-roblox)).
