**This development will be postponed because of busy school schedules and insane procrastination.
I will consider switching to C++ (if I wanted to) and good luck to myself handling memory
on my own**

## Ribbon

An alternative program to [lemur](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/lemur)
(not planning to be successor of it) that implements most of Roblox's API in
order to enable Roblox projects to have continuous integration without
depending on Roblox Studio in some CIs (like [run-in-roblox](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/run-in-roblox)).

**WARNING:**
Most deprecated methods and members are not supported (and never will implement them)!
